# bdUI
An all-in-one UI that aims to be compatible with all official versions of WoW. It supports live WoW, as well as Classic, and will support other official releases if they happen.

bdUI is fully modular. You can install the full UI and only use certain portions of it. Its high performance, unobtrusive, and progression raiding-oriented. Its less feature-rich than other addons, but aims to be streamlined and extentable in the features it does offer.
